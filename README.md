# WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

The back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. You’ll gain a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. The eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Technologies and Techniques Used

- **Express.js**: Web application framework for handling HTTP requests
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user and clothing item data
- **Mongoose**: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **JSON Web Tokens**: For user authentication
- **Input Validation**: Using validator.js
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes and middleware
- **ESLint**: Code linting with Airbnb style guide
- **Nodemon**: Development server with hot reload

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Testing

Before committing your code, make sure you edit the file `sprint.txt` in the root folder. The file `sprint.txt` should contain the number of the sprint you're currently working on. For ex. 12
